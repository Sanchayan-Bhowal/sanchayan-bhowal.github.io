I am a Mathematics masterâ€™s student at the Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore. My main interest is in probability theory. Currently, I am working on my masterâ€™s project under the guidance of [Bhaswar Bhattacharya](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~bhaswar/) and [Somabha Mukherjee](https://www.somabha.com/).
