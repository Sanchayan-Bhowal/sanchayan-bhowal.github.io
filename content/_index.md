Welcome to my homepage ðŸ‘‹ 
I am a Mathematics masterâ€™s student at the [Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore](https://www.isibang.ac.in/~statmath/). My main interest is in probability theory. I am an incoming graduate student at the [Statistics](https://statistics.stanford.edu) Department of Stanford University. Currently, I am working on my masterâ€™s project under the guidance of [Bhaswar Bhattacharya](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~bhaswar/) and [Somabha Mukherjee](https://www.somabha.com/).
