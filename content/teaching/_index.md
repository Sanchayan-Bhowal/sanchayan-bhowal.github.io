## Reading Seminars

1. <kbd>Jan - Apr 2025</kbd> : Entropy and Markov Chains

    As part of this seminar, we recalled the basics of mixing times from Salez's notes. Currently, we are trying to understand the work of Chen and Eldan on Localization schemes. Finally, we want to read the paper by Caputo and Salez on Entropy factorization.

2. <kbd>Mar - Apr 2024</kbd> : Riemann Surfaces

    We started with the basics of Riemann surfaces and covered till Riemann-Roch theorem.
