As I now prepare to embark on a PhD journey, I want to reflect on how I got here—the challenges, the inspirations, and the lessons learned along the way.

### The Beginning: Finding My Passion

My academic journey began when I joined ISI as a BMath student. In my first year, I mostly liked the algebra and probability courses, while analysis was something I struggled with back then. Upon being promoted to my second year, I heard that one of my seniors from MMath had secured a PhD position at Princeton. This inspired me to explore research opportunities, and I had a chance to chat with him. Through this conversation, I learned about the SN Bhatt Memorial Fellowship at ICTS. I applied and, fortunately, got selected. This opportunity allowed me to spend a summer reading about the Cutoff Phenomenon under the guidance of two eminent probabilists, Prof. Riddhipratim Basu and Prof. Anirban Basak. This project streamlined my interest in probability.

### My Failure

Around this time, after my second year in BMath, I was preparing to apply for PhD positions in the US. Many professors advised me against it, suggesting that I complete a master’s degree first. However, seeing many of my seniors successfully secure PhD positions, I was motivated to apply anyway. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately), I was not selected. This led me to stay at ISI for my MMath, while many of my peers went to institutions worldwide. In retrospect, this decision allowed me to further develop my research skills and refine my interests in probability.

### My First Research

One random day after sulking that I did not get into a PhD, I decided to search for professors who were looking for students as research assistants. I was going through the ISI alumni and then I found Prof. Somabha, who had just graduated with a PhD and was looking for students. I mailed him my profile, asking for a project. Fortunately, I got a reply, and he was interested in discussing further. He asked me to read a few papers, and then I was good to go. He gave me a problem to work on. Initially, it looked like a huge task, but gradually, I understood the process, tried to prove small lemmas, and finally, I had results. It was a huge experience for me.

### My First Trip to the US

Around the time I started working with Prof. Somabha, I was also selected for the BDSI program at the University of Michigan. I was thrilled about this opportunity. My journey began in Chicago, and from there, I took an Amtrak train to Michigan, an experience in itself. At Michigan, I had the privilege of working with faculty from the statistics department, gaining valuable practical knowledge and learning how to apply theoretical concepts to real-world data. The highlight of the program was presenting my work in front of a large audience, which was both challenging and rewarding. Beyond academics, I thoroughly enjoyed participating in social events and making lifelong friends. This experience broadened my perspective and strengthened my passion for research.

### The Pivotal Summer: 2024

After returning from BDSI, I started my MMath, focusing on my courses and striving to do well. Summer 2024 was the most crucial period concerning my PhD applications. I completed a project with Prof. Somabha, and during this time, I had the opportunity to meet Prof. Bhaswar. The three of us began collaborating on a project, and both professors agreed to supervise my master's research. With my second year set to begin, I also started preparing for PhD applications, drafting my Statement of Purpose (SOP). For future applicants, I would emphasize that the summer before applying is the most critical time—you should have all required documents prepared in advance, as managing applications during the semester can be overwhelming.

### Conferences: The Underrated Experience

During my time in BMath and MMath, I attended three major conferences. Each was a unique learning experience.

The first conference I attended was during my third year of BMath. I was the youngest participant. I tried to follow the lectures, but most of the time, I was lost. If you're in a similar situation, don't get discouraged. Focus on understanding the first 5–10 minutes of each talk.

The second conference felt easier to navigate. I was more mathematically mature and could engage with researchers actively working in probability. Although I still didn’t understand everything, I felt more confident asking questions and initiating discussions.

The last conference was the best experience. Siva had organized a research school where participants collaborated on projects. I had the chance to work with Prof. Bhaswar on multiplex random graphs. The following week was the main conference. The most exciting part was the intense mathematical discussions and the opportunity to meet many incredible people.

### The D-DAY

After returning from my last conference at CMI, it was January 2025—the month when PhD decisions were expected. In mid-January, I received my first offer from Yale. After facing rejection from all programs during my BMath, this felt like a huge breakthrough.

Then came February 7, 2025—one of the best days of my life. I got into Stanford, my top choice. For a few seconds, I couldn’t believe it. It felt like all the time I had spent at ISI had finally paid off. By the end of the cycle, I had offers from Yale, Stanford, Purdue, Harvard, and the University of Pennsylvania. Each was a fantastic opportunity, but I had to make a decision. In the end, I chose Stanford.

### Looking Ahead

As I move forward, I hope to share more of my experiences—the highs and the lows. If you're considering a research career in probability from India, feel free to reach out. I'm happy to share my insights and suggestions, but please be mindful of my time.
